                            p This was the my final year project in NUS. In this project, I built and attempt to validate the working efficiency of an electric canard rotor wing aircraft.
                            p The research of this type of aircraft was not new and has been done by Boeing in the Dragonfly project. However, an electric version of this aircraft was not attempted before and I wanted to know if it was feasible to think of this aircraft as a replacement to conventional drones. This project proved to be a significant challenge to my skills, but it gave me many opportunities to hone my engineering skills for my future endeavours.
