                            p The goal of this project was to attempt the craziest Radio-Controlled (RC) aircraft that I could think of. The aircraft features a canard front wing with a main wing that has both forward and backward sweep and taper. Calculations for lift and stability were done using OpenVSP and other airfoil tools.
                            p It uses 4 motors in a Y4 configuration for VTOL. The rear motors on the main wing are coupled together and rotate backwards for forward flight using a single servo and a Geneva mechanism. The motors and transition mechanism were programmed using Inav with a F4 flight controller.
                            p Eventually, I managed to test its vertical flight mode only before I wanted to move on to other projects; you can check it out in the link below =). I had great fun working this project and I learned a lot. I do hope that one day I can revisit this project in the future to make it work.
